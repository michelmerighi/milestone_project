# Band Project

In this project i want to create a website for a famous rock band. 
I have decided to keep it simple so that people do not have to waste time on looking for something as everything is clearly divided in different sections.
I have created four main sections indeed: the first one describes to member of the band, the second one provides pictures and videos, the third one contains tracks of songs alphabetically ordered, the last section gives information about future events and provides fans with an opportunity to invite the band at their events. 

Features

The website that I created is is aimed at capturing the attention of current fans and new ones with four main sections : Members, Videos and Images, Tracks and Events.
These sections are very easy to access, they are indeed at the top of the page so that anyone can immediately see them. In order to be immediately seen and in order to be easy to be accessed I have decided to use a contrasting colour, i.e. orange. The same colour that I used for the social media links at the very bottom of the page. 
In the Members section I present all the group members with a picture and a short description. To give new fans a general idea of the musicians in the band.
The Videos and Images section contains links to videos taken from Youtube and some pictures from the images folder of the website. I believe this would help people, as they will not have to search songs and videos somewhere else as they are already there, ready to be listeded and watched.
In the Track page I created a link, so that people would be able to just listen and relax with this band songs.
The events section contains some information about the next band concerts and gives a great occasion to fans that want to have their favourite band as part of their parties or events. For this reason I have created a .....
Facebook, Instagram and  Youtube social media accounts are very important for fans to keep updated about the band everyday activities therefore I linked them in the footer of the page.
