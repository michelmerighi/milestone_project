# Band Project

In this project i want to create a website for a famous rock band. 
I have decided to keep it simple so that people do not have to waste time on looking for something as everything is clearly divided in different sections.
I have created four main sections indeed: the first one describes to member of the band, the second one provides pictures and videos, the third one contains tracks of songs alphabetically ordered, the last section gives information about future events and provides fans with an opportunity to invite the band at their events. 


UX (User Experience)
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

The website that I created is is aimed at capturing the attention of current fans and new ones with four main sections : Members, Videos and Images, Tracks and Events.
These sections are very easy to access, they are indeed at the top of the page so that anyone can immediately see them. In order to be immediately seen and in order to be easy to be accessed I have decided to use a contrasting colour, i.e. orange. The same colour that I used for the social media links at the very bottom of the page. 
In the Members section I present all the group members with a picture and a short description. To give new fans a general idea of the musicians in the band.
The Videos and Images section contains links to videos taken from Youtube and some pictures from the images folder of the website. I believe this would help people, as they will not have to search songs and videos somewhere else as they are already there, ready to be listeded and watched.
In the Track page I created a link, so that people would be able to just listen and relax with this band songs.
The events section contains some information about the next band concerts and gives a great occasion to fans that want to have their favourite band as part of their parties or events. For this reason I have created a .....
Facebook, Instagram and  Youtube social media accounts are very important for fans to keep updated about the band everyday activities therefore I linked them in the footer of the page.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
